To run this project after repository clone, in the main directory on your host, type:

$ docker-compose up

Next weâ€™ll need to set the application key & run the optimize command.

$ docker-compose exec app php artisan key:generate

$ docker-compose exec app php artisan optimize

To create databases, we need run:

$ docker-compose exec app php artisan migrate

And to seed the database with fake information, run:

$ docker-compose exec app php artisan db:seed
